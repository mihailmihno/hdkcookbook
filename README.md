HDK Cookbook
============

This repository will contain code for SideFX Houdini Development Kit. 
Based on: https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/_h_d_k__intro__creating_plugins.html

I will try to create some easy to find examples for basic everyday tasks for people who wants to have some specific functionality inside Houidni and who has to write additional plugins for it. 

CONENTS:
