HDK Cookbook
============

This repository will contain code for SideFX Houdini Development Kit. 
Based on: https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/_h_d_k__intro__creating_plugins.html

I don't have specific schedule for this repository, but when I find some interesting task during my primary work I will try to create some easy to find and good to show examples for basic everyday tasks for people who wants to have some specific functionality inside Houdni and who has to write additional plugins for it. 

DISCLAIMER: It is NOT guide how to write C++ or HDK plugin in a "good" way... Think about it like idea notes that are made to not be forgotted and might be used by anyone later.
